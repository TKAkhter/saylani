            <p><b>Chughtai Lab will soon receive Russia’s Sputnik V Covid-19 vaccine for commercial
                    sale, a
                    company official said on Sunday, making Pakistan one of the first countries to
                    market
                    shots privately as it scrambles to secure supplies.</b></p>

            <p>Despite concerns over fairness and higher prices, Islamabad agreed this week to allow
                the
                commercial import and sale of vaccines <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1606771">without price
                    caps</a>, in contrast to most
                countries, which are importing and administering vaccines through government channels.
            </p>
            <p>“We are told the first shipment is expected within the next week,” Chughtai
                Lab
                director
                Omar Chughtai told <em>Reuters</em>, adding it would be receiving several
                thousand
                doses. He also confirmed the news on Twitter.
            </p>
            <p>Pakistan’s decision to allow private sales of vaccine without a price cap
                in
                a
                lower-income country of 220 million people faces criticism.</p>
            <p>Former special assistant to the prime minister on health Dr Zafar Mirza,
                while
                praising
                government efforts to procure and distribute free vaccine, said that
                avoiding a
                price
                cap for private sales “will deepen inequality in society at a time when
                there is a
                need
                to have widespread coverage”.</p>

            <p>The government <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1605205/pakistan-begins-vaccine-roll-out">launched
                    a
                    vaccination drive</a> this month with 500,000 doses of the Sinopharm
                vaccine
                donated
                by longtime ally China. But aside from the donated Chinese doses,
                Islamabad
                has not
                completed any deals to buy vaccines.</p>

            <h2>Prices will 'appear inflated'</h2>

            <p>Sputnik V is one of four vaccines approved for emergency use in Pakistan,
                in
                addition
                to
                those by China’s Sinopharm and CanSinoBio, and the AstraZeneca-Oxford
                University
                shot.
            </p>

            <p>Chughtai Lab aims to import the others as well, but Sputnik V was the
                first
                to become
                available, Chughtai said.</p>

            <p>Special Assistant to the Prime Minister on Health Faisal Sultan told
                <em>Reuters</em>
                in
                a message he was “not directly aware” of the deal.
            </p>

            <p>Chughtai declined to specify import costs or prices but said the price
                would
                “appear
                inflated” compared to what has been reported for Sputnik V globally,
                given
                the
                smaller
                volume it was planning to sell relative to global procurement.</p>

            <p>Sputnik V’s developers have said the two-dose vaccine would be sold at
                $10
                per dose.
            </p>

            <p>“Internationally there is very high demand, and I would not be surprised
                if
                the price
                points are higher today,” Chughtai said, adding that prices will come
                down
                over the
                next
                three to four months as more vaccine becomes available.</p>

            <p>“The biggest challenge around the vaccines globally right now is
                allocation
                to
                specific
                countries,” he said.</p>

            <p>Chughtai said his Lahore-based pathology lab had turned down “grey
                market”
                offers
                from
                people in various countries who had “extra vaccine” not officially meant
                for
                re-export.
            </p>

            <p>The lab is importing Sputnik V through Pakistani firm Ali Gohar
                Pharmaceuticals Pvt
                and
                the Russian Direct Investment Fund, which is responsible for marketing
                the
                vaccine
                abroad.</p>

            <p>Chughtai said he expected an official government decree in the next two
                days
                specifying
                rules on inoculations by the private sector, including on registration
                of
                recipients.
                The company expects to receive shipments every four to five days.</p>
