    <p>The <strong>Fahrenheit</strong> scale (/ˈfɑːrənhaɪt/) is a temperature scale based on one proposed in 1724 by the
        physicist Daniel Gabriel Fahrenheit (1686–1736). It uses the degree Fahrenheit (symbol: °F) as the unit. Several
        accounts of how he originally defined his scale exist, but the original paper suggests the lower defining point,
        0 °F, was established as the freezing temperature of a solution of brine made from a mixture of water, ice, and
        ammonium chloride (a salt).The other limit established was his best estimate of the average human body
        temperature (set at 96 °F; about 2.6 °F less than the modern value due to a later redefinition of the
        scale).However, he noted a middle point of 32 °F, to be set to the temperature of ice water.

        The Fahrenheit scale is now usually defined by two fixed points: the temperature at which pure water freezes
        into ice is defined as 32 °F and the boiling point of water is defined to be 212 °F, both at sea level and under
        standard atmospheric pressure (a 180 °F separation).
